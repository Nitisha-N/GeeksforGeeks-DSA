# 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) — Daily Practice

This repository contains my **daily DSA practice solutions in Python**, primarily solved from **GeeksforGeeks** as part of my structured learning journey.

The goal of this repository is **not just to store code**, but to:
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Maintain consistency in daily practice
- Document my learning and thought process over time

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Represents

- Solutions are written in **Python**
- Problems are solved as part of **GeeksforGeeks DSA practice**
- Focus is on **clarity, correctness, and understanding**
- Code follows platform constraints (no external libraries unless allowed)

This is a **learning-first repository**, and solutions may improve over time as my understanding deepens.

---

## ✍️ Coding Approach

- Problems are solved **step-by-step**
- Emphasis on:
  - Time complexity
  - Space complexity
  - Readability
- Avoids over-optimization unless required

Each solution is written as if explaining to a **fellow beginner or junior analyst**.

---

## 🚀 Progress Tracking

- ✔ Daily practice mindset
- ✔ Focus on fundamentals
- ✔ Improving code quality over time
- ✔ Revisiting older solutions for refinement

---

## 🧩 Platforms Used

- **GeeksforGeeks** (Primary)
- Occasional cross-practice on similar DSA platforms

---

## 📌 Note

This repository reflects my **learning journey**, not perfection.
Mistakes are part of the process, and improvements are intentional.
